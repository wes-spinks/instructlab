## v0.18

### Features

* Add [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) backend to serve, chat and generate commands.
* Add `--backend` flag to `ilab model serve` command to allow for specifying the backend to use
   when serving a model. This is useful when you have multiple backends installed and want to
   specify which one to use. Currently, the only supported backend are `llama-cpp` and `vllm`.
* Update `llama-cpp-python` to latest upstream release 0.2.79 to address poor
  results of synthetic data generation and local training.
* Adding `ilab model evaluate` which uses the new backend serving functionality.  Evaluate offers
   two standard benchmarks (mt-bench and mmlu) as well as two variations (mt-bench-branch and
   mmlu-branch) which are integrated with the ilab workflow to evaluate new skills and knowledge.
   Includes --gpus option for specifying number of gpus to utilize when serving models for
   evaluation (currently applicable for vLLM only).  Also includes --merge-system-user-message
   flag to enable Mistral based judge models and a --enable-serving-output flag that
   configures whether the output of the model serving backend is suppressed.
* The `ilab` command now accepts a `-v` / `--verbose` option to enable debug logging.
  `ilab -vv` or `ilab --verbose --verbose` enables more verbose debug logging.
* `ilab model test` generic support
   evaluation (currently applicable for vLLM only).
* Add `--chat-template` option to `ilab model serve` to support customization of the chat
   template for both vLLM and llama.cpp backends. Options include 'auto' (current behavior, ilab
   provides its own template), 'tokenizer' (uses the model's tokenizer config), and an external
   file name.
* Default log format changes to include the logger name in the logs.
* Add `--save-safetensors` to `ilab model train` command to allow keeping (not unlinking)
   the generated safetensor files in ./training_results/final/

### Breaking Changes

* `ilab`: **Deprecation of Python 3.9 support and withdrawal of Python 3.12 support** Due to changes to training requiring the usage of [GPTDolomite](https://github.com/instructlab/GPTDolomite), Python 3.9 is no longer supported and Python 3.12 support is currently withdrawn. If you are using either of these versions, you will need to start using either Python 3.10 or Python 3.11 to use this and subsequent versions of the CLI.
* `ilab model train`: The '--device' parameter no longer supports specifying a GPU index (e.g., 'cuda:0'). To use a specific GPU, set the visible GPU before running the train command.

## v0.17

### Features

#### ilab command redesign

The ilab command redesign included in v0.17 introduces a new command structure that follows a resource group design. This means that commands that once were something like `ilab chat` now are `ilab model chat`. The new groups are model, data, taxonomy, and config. The commands that fall under these are all of the pre-existing `ilab` commands just now grouped by the resource which the command commonly deals with.

The old command structure is still aliased to work but will be removed in 0.19.0. This means for 0.17.0 and 0.18.0 the aliases will exist and work as expected.
